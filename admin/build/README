Psi Build Scripts
-----------------

First, prepare your environment according to the prereqs in psideps/README.

To create packages for Windows, set QTDIR64 and QTDIR32, and pass VERSION to
make. For example:

  cd admin/build
  QTDIR64=c:/qt/4.8.2-w64 QTDIR32=c:/qt/4.8.2 make VERSION=0.15-mybuild

You must set both Qt paths. The scripts do not support packaging just for one
arch.

For Mac:

  cd admin/build
  QTDIR=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.2 make VERSION=0.15-mybuild

It is also possible to prepare a dev environment using similar scripting:

Configure for Windows 64-bit:

  QTDIR64=c:/qt/4.8.2-w64 admin/build/devconfig.sh x86_64

Configure for Windows 32-bit:

  QTDIR32=c:/qt/4.8.2 admin/build/devconfig.sh i386

Configure for Mac:

  QTDIR=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.2 admin/build/devconfig.sh ""

Executing one of these commands will cause all Psi dependencies to be
downloaded, configure run against these dependencies, and a file named devenv
generated with all necessary environment variables to build. Then you can
proceed as follows:

  . admin/build/devenv
  make (or mingw32-make, if on Windows)

You can then run the Psi executable from within the shell to test it and
everything needed will be found, without having to create a full distribution
directory.
